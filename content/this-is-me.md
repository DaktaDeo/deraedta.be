### Community 
Opensource is the way the world should work: all people working together to make it a better place.
Contribute when they can, combine knowledge. You learn so much from what others have done! 
I‚Äôm all for a healthy mix: opensource when needed, closed when its necessary.

### I'm good at...
I‚Äôm good at problem solving, networking with people, positive thinking, coaching people, doing routine work, expert in Microsoft Office.

#### Some history
At regular base I change my job because I don't want to get stuck.

Since 2016 I followed one of my fellow workers to a new project: starting the [professional bachelor in Network Economy](https://netwerkeconomie.org)
It feels as walk my talk. Everything was new to learn.

#### Toolbox
As communication-tool I don't have preferences. I have at least 20 projects running and they all use different tools like Slack, WhatsApp, Teams, Messenger, Signal or Telegram.

I was addicted to Microsoft Office.üòÅ
