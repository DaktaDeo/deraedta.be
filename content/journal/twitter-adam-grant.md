<small>Integrity is walking the talk. Your actions live up to your words.
Authenticity is only talking what you already walk. Your words reflect your actions.
It’s good to practice what you preach. It’s better to reserve your preaching for the principles you consistently practice.</small>

Dixit Adam Grant. My first question was, why do I follow this man on Twitter? 
Did a read a book of him? Checking #Goodreads... No
Did a listen to a Ted Talk? Perhaps, I didn't mark one of his.
So after all this years I don't know why this person is interesting for me. But the quote is the inspiration for my next sleep.
