Since Covid-19 times (March 2020) I work more together with [Veerle](https://gompje.be/). It began with calls and little by little we became a community.
In the beginning I was only listening, after some weeks I was taking notes and after somes months we started a funded team.
All of this time Veerle takes always the time to explain me the IT stuff. Around 2000 it was the other way around. It was the time that I was teaching because I had the knowledge. I'm so thankfull that I have the chance to learn from this professional "junior".

I thought I had a lot of patience, but I often put Veerle's patience to the test.
