<small>In schools are a lot of services for students that needs extra support for their studies. There is less support to make the better students the best. I like to do an effort here. Can I help to make a programme that can be applied for students to let them excellerate?</small>

## Programma 1 - Tarant ##
* **Student**: Mashal Momand is the first studente to start in the Excellence Programme üí™üèº. She likes to develop her digital skills. It's a broad concept, so doing practical work might help here to see what she really wants and likes.
* **Organisation**: I met Kathleen Nuelant on a refugee walk, organised by [Howest Postgraduaat Migration and Refugees](https://www.howest.be*/nl/opleidingen/english-taught-semester/migration-and-refugees "Howest") in october 2021. The story about [Taranta vzw](https://vzwtaranta.wordpress.com/ "Taranta vzw") was the talk that kept us warm during that rainy day.
* **Goal**: Mashal want to learn and practice digital skills, Kathleen want to build out the community and work out the website, communication and social media.
