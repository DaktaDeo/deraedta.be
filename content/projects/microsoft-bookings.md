<small>Microsoft Bookings is a Microsoft 365 app that makes scheduling and managing appointments easy. Bookings includes a Web-based booking calendar and integrates with Outlook to optimize your staff’s calendar, giving your customers flexibility to book a time that works best for them. </small>

At [Howest](https://www.howest.be) we have a very good learning management system (LMS), named Leho, based on [Canvas Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/en-gb/canvas). It means a very good communication tool with the students, in my rol as a teacher 👩🏼‍🏫.

At high schools in Belgium a lot of teachers has a second role of researcher. That can be for very practical stuff. I'm a Office software lover. I like to offer my expertise to the Flemish community in a one-euro helpdesk format. Making appointments with external people is still a struggle. Sinds September 2021 I try the [Microsoft Bookings tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-faq?view=o365-worldwide).

If you want to use my expertise, you can [book a free hour in my Booking calendar](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/Howest3419277@hogeschool-wvl.be/bookings/). Feel free, I'll be happy to help you 🙏.

The Youtube Channel ['Modern Onderwijs'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mt-LA8lIZ0) was my inspiration article. In 15 minutes I got a good overview of all the function. The focus is on Education and not on Business. Just what I needed 💪.

## Update 28th March
In the second semester, students do a 1-day internship at two companies. One of the challenges is finding a suitable date. Microsoft Booking proves its service here. Top!

I learned from the above experiment, and added a link to "book a call with me" in my email signature. It works for students, colleagues and external parties.
I am satisfied with this extension on my calendar.
