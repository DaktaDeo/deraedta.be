🤔 Hmm...Good question! I'm an engineer with a goal: getting the administration effective.

Why?

To free up time to do the nice things in live. 😊

Let's start that again, shall we?

Hi there, 👋 <br/>I’m Ann Deraedt, a teacher, ex-entrepreneur, volunteer, 
housewife, gardener, reader, runner, and I love to be outside.

And yes... I do have my very own homelab in Menen -thats in Belgium. 😏

Oh. Yeah. I do speak Dutch as well. In fact it’s my mother tongue.. technically..

I ❤ my husband, my friends, my family, my work, my students, Excel, improving my life, reading, being outdoors and just running.

Sometimes <nuxt-link to="/articles">I write useful posts</nuxt-link>, <nuxt-link to="/journal">sometimes very silly</nuxt-link>, and <nuxt-link to="/fff">stuff for friends, family and fools</nuxt-link>.  **But most times I work with other people.**  

<small>.. I&#8217;m also a supporter &#8211; of [Brugge Marine Center](https://www.bruggemarinecenter.com)!</small>

**ESFJ &#8211; W**ork.**I**n.**P**rogress ✌️
